# About
---

Ichs is a module I made for fun in around 20 minutes. As of writing, there are only two functions but I do plan to add more.

# Twitter
---
```py
ichs.twitter()
```
Will return Ichs' Twitter page.

Usage:
```py
import ichs

twitter = ichs.twitter()
print(twitter)
```
```
http://www.twitter.com/IlfordCountySch
```
# Website
---
```py
ichs.website()
```
Will return the Ichs website.

Usage:
```py
import ichs

website = ichs.website()
print(website)
```
```
